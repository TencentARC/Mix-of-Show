### Whats in here?

We include the checksums of the images we used to compute CLIPScore
for the paper. Because the evaluation metric depends on the image
itself, things like jpg compression, resizing, etc. can impact
reproducability. We downloaded the datasets from the original sources
and didn't modify them. But if you're having trouble matching these
checksums, definitely get in touch!
